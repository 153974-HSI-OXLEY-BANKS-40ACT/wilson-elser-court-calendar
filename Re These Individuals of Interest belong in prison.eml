>     Weapons Convention; and
>             (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances

>         (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General
>     shall provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition

              collection in violation of section 1962.<br>
              The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall
              order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant

              defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an
              offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits
              or other proceeds.<br>

              <br>
              <br>
              (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever,
              being an officer or employee of the executive branch of
              the United States Government, or of any independent agency
              of the United States, a Federal Reserve bank director,
              officer, or employee, or an officer or employee of the
              District of Columbia, including a special Government
              employee, participates personally and substantially as a
              Government officer or employee, through decision,
              approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of
              advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or
              other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or
              other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge,
              accusation, arrest, or other particular matter in which,
              to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general
              partner, organization in which he is serving as officer,
              director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any
              person or organization with whom he is negotiating or has
              any arrangement concerning prospective employment, has a
              financial interest-Shall be subject to the penalties set
              forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
              (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
              (1) if the officer or employee first advises the
              Government official responsible for appointment to his or
              her position of the nature and circumstances of the
              judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a
              ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
              controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other
              particular matter and makes full disclosure of the
              financial interest and receives in advance a written
              determination made by such official that the interest is
              not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the
              integrity of the services which the Government may expect
              from such officer or employee;<br>
              (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office
              of Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of
              all officers and employees covered by this section, and
              published in the Federal Register, the financial interest
              has been exempted from the requirements of subsection (a)
              as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the
              integrity of the services of the Government officers or
              employees to which such regulation applies;<br>
              (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving
              on an advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal
              Advisory Committee Act (including an individual being
              considered for an appointment to such a position), the
              official responsible for the employee's appointment, after
              review of the financial disclosure report filed by the
              individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of
              1978, certifies in writing that the need for the
              individual's services outweighs the potential for a
              conflict of interest created by the financial interest
              involved...<br>

              conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the
              use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
              against property or against the person of another in
              violation of the laws of the United States, and under

              (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under
              this section that, under circumstances manifesting a
              voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal
              intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the
              crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and
              complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a
              decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
              another time or to substitute another victim or another
              but similar objective. If the defendant raises the
              affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden
              of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.<br>
                  (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this
              section that the person solicited could not be convicted
              of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required
              for its commission, because he was incompetent or
              irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or
              is not subject to prosecution.<br>

                  -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall
              forfeit to the United States irrespective of any provision
              of State law-<br>
                      (1) any property, real or personal, owned,
              possessed, or used by a person involved in the offense;<br>

              and proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly,
              as the result of such violation; and<br>
                      (3) any of the property used in any manner or

              violation.<br>
              <br>
                  The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall
              order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant
              to section 229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United
              States all property described in this subsection. In lieu
              of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a
              defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an
              offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits
              or other proceeds.<br>

                      (1) General.<br>
                      -Property subject to forfeiture under this
              section, any seizure and disposition thereof, and any
              administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto,
              shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of
              section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
              Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any
              reference under those subsections to-<br>
                          (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall
              be deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
                          (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a
              reference to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
                      (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
                          (A)     In general.-For the purposes of
              forfeiture proceedings under this section, a temporary
              restraining order may be entered upon application of the
              United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing
              when an information or indictment has not yet been filed
              with respect to the property, if, in addition to the
              circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the
              Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
              1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates
              that there is probable cause to believe that the property
              with respect to which the order is sought would, in the
              event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this
              section and exigent circumstances exist that place the
              life or health of any person in danger.<br>
                          (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court
              enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph,
              it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of
              such property.<br>
                          (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures
              and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders
              under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug
              Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.
              853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining
              orders under this paragraph.<br>
                  (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                      -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture
              under subsection (b) that the property-<br>
                      (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the
              Chemical Weapons Convention; and<br>
                      (2) is of a type and quantity that under the
              circumstances is consistent with that purpose.<br>
                  (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney
              General shall provide for the destruction or other
              appropriate disposition of any chemical weapon seized and
              forfeited pursuant to this section.<br>
                  (e) Assistance.<br>
                  (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                      -The owner or possessor of any property seized
              under this section shall be liable to the United States
              for any expenses incurred incident to the seizure,
              including any expenses relating to the handling, storage,
              transportation, and destruction or other disposition of
              the seized property<br>

              **        (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct

              title, or both.**<br>
              **    (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil
              action in the appropriate United States district court
              against any person who engages in conduct constituting an
              offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 208, or 209 of
              this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a
              preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be
              subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for
              each violation or the amount of compensation which the
              person received or offered for the prohibited conduct,
              whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil
              penalty under this subsection does not preclude any other
              criminal or civil statutory, common law, or administrative
              remedy, which is available by law to the United States or

              this title, the Attorney General may petition an
              appropriate United States district court for an order
              prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct. The
              court may issue an order prohibiting that person from
              engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the
              conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a

              conduct constituting a felony that has as an element the
              use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
              against property or against the person of another in

              (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under
              this section that, under circumstances manifesting a
              voluntary and complete renunciation of his criminal
              intent, the defendant prevented the commission of the
              crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and
              complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a
              decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
              another time or to substitute another victim or another
              but similar objective. If the defendant raises the
              affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden
              of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.<br>
                  (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this
              section that the person solicited could not be convicted
              of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required
              for its commission, because he was incompetent or
              irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or
              is not subject to prosecution.<br>

              order, in addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant
              to section 229A(a), that the person forfeit to the United
              States all property described in this subsection. In lieu
              of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a
              defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an
              offense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits

                      (1) General.<br>
                      -Property subject to forfeiture under this
              section, any seizure and disposition thereof, and any
              administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto,
              shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of
              section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and
              Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any
              reference under those subsections to-<br>
                          (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall
              be deemed to be a reference to section 229A(a); and<br>
                          (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a
              reference to subsection (a) of this section.<br>
                      (2) Temporary restraining orders.-<br>
                          (A)     In general.-For the purposes of
              forfeiture proceedings under this section, a temporary
              restraining order may be entered upon application of the
              United States without notice or opportunity for a hearing
              when an information or indictment has not yet been filed
              with respect to the property, if, in addition to the
              circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the
              Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
              1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the United States demonstrates
              that there is probable cause to believe that the property
              with respect to which the order is sought would, in the
              event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this
              section and exigent circumstances exist that place the
              life or health of any person in danger.<br>
                          (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court
              enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph,
              it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of
              such property.<br>
                          (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures
              and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders
              under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug
              Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.
              853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining
              orders under this paragraph.<br>
                  (c) Affirmative Defense.<br>
                      -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture
              under subsection (b) that the property-<br>
                      (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the
              Chemical Weapons Convention; and<br>
                      (2) is of a type and quantity that under the
              circumstances is consistent with that purpose.<br>
                  (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney
              General shall provide for the destruction or other
              appropriate disposition of any chemical weapon seized and
              forfeited pursuant to this section.<br>
                  (e) Assistance.<br>
                  (f) Owner Liability.<br>
                      -The owner or possessor of any property seized
              under this section shall be liable to the United States
              for any expenses incurred incident to the seizure,
              including any expenses relating to the handling, storage,
              transportation, and destruction or other disposition of
              the seized property<br>

              subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for

              penalty under this subsection does not preclude any other
              criminal or civil statutory, common law, or administrative
              remedy, which is available by law to the United States or

              this title, the Attorney General may petition an
              appropriate United States district court for an order

              Authority, and the Securities and Exchange Commission -
              Notwithstanding the New York State Supreme Court, the New
              York Department of Finance, and the NYC Finance Register -
              as referenced below.&lt;br&gt; *§21. Stolen or counterfeit
              nature of property for certain crimes defined (a) Wherever
              in this title it is an element of an offense that- (1) any
              property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken,
              altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or
              obliterated; and (2) the defendant knew that the property
              was of such character; -such element may be established by
              proof that the defendant, after or as a result of an
              official representation as to the nature of the property,
              believed the property to be embezzled, robbed, stolen,
              converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made,
              forged, or obliterated. -(b) For purposes of this section,
              the term "official representation" means any
              representation made by a Federal law enforcement officer
              (as defined in section 115) or by another person at the

              (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if
              directly performed by him or another would be an offense
              against the United States, is punishable as a principal.
              §3. - Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an
              offense against the United States has been committed,
              receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in
              order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or
              punishment, is an accessory after the fact. Except as
              otherwise expressly provided by any Act of Congress, an
              accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than
              one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or
              (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more than
              one-half the maximum fine prescribed for the punishment of
              the principal, or both; or if the principal is punishable
              by life imprisonment or death, the accessory shall be
              imprisoned not more than 15 years. §4. Misprision of
              felony Whoever, having knowledge of the actual commission
              of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States,

              directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or
              unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962. The
              court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in
              addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this
              section, that the person forfeit to the United States all
              property described in this subsection. In lieu of a fine
              otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who
              derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be
              fined not more than twice the gross profits or other
              proceeds. (b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture
              under this section includes- (1) real property, including
              things growing on, affixed to, and found in land; and (2)

              against property or against the person of another in

              prosecution under this section that, under circumstances
              manifesting a voluntary and complete renunciation of his
              criminal intent, the defendant prevented the commission of
              the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and
              complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a
              decision to postpone the commission of the crime until
              another time or to substitute another victim or another
              but similar objective. If the defendant raises the
              affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden
              of proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
              (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this
              section that the person solicited could not be convicted
              of the crime because he lacked the state of mind required
              for its commission, because he was incompetent or
              irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution or
              is not subject to prosecution.

              weapons (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture. -Any
              person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to
              the United States irrespective of any provision of State
              law- (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed,
              or used by a person involved in the offense; (2) any
              property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds the
              person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of
              such violation; and (3) any of the property used in any
              manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission
              of, such violation. The court, in imposing sentence on
              such person, shall order, in addition to any other
              sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that the
              person forfeit to the United States all property described
              in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized
              by section 229A(a), a defendant who derived profits or
              other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more than
              twice the gross profits or other proceeds. (b)
              Procedures.- (1) General. -Property subject to forfeiture
              under this section, any seizure and disposition thereof,
              and any administrative or judicial proceeding in relation
              thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p)
              of section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
              and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any
              reference under those subsections to- (A) "this subchapter
              or subchapter II" shall be deemed to be a reference to
              section 229A(a); and (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed
              to be a reference to subsection (a) of this section. (2)
              Temporary restraining orders.- (A) In general.-For the
              purposes of forfeiture proceedings under this section, a
              temporary restraining order may be entered upon
              application of the United States without notice or
              opportunity for a hearing when an information or
              indictment has not yet been filed with respect to the
              property, if, in addition to the circumstances described
              in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
              Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)),
              the United States demonstrates that there is probable
              cause to believe that the property with respect to which
              the order is sought would, in the event of conviction, be
              subject to forfeiture under this section and exigent
              circumstances exist that place the life or health of any
              person in danger. (B) Warrant of seizure.-If the court
              enters a temporary restraining order under this paragraph,
              it shall also issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of
              such property. (C) Applicable procedures.-The procedures
              and time limits applicable to temporary restraining orders
              under section 413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug
              Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C.
              853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary restraining
              orders under this paragraph. (c) Affirmative Defense. -It
              is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under
              subsection (b) that the property- (1) is for a purpose not
              prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and (2)
              is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is
              consistent with that purpose. (d) Destruction or Other
              Disposition.-The Attorney General shall provide for the
              destruction or other appropriate disposition of any
              chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this
              section. (e) Assistance. (f) Owner Liability. -The owner
              or possessor of any property seized under this section
              shall be liable to the United States for any expenses
              incurred incident to the seizure, including any expenses
              relating to the handling, storage, transportation, and
              destruction or other disposition of the seized property

              Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense

              the amount set forth in this title, or both.** ** (2)
              Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the
              offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years
              or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both.**
              ** (b) The Attorney General may bring a civil action in

              title and, upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance

              offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is
              greater. The imposition of a civil penalty under this
              subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil
              statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is
              available by law to the United States or any other

              of this title, the Attorney General may petition an
              appropriate United States district court for an order
              prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct. The
              court may issue an order prohibiting that person from
              engaging in such conduct if the court finds that the
              conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a
